# LandingPage
Landing page project (partly written by Udacity)
This single page has several functions:
1. When you scroll up or down, the corresponding button at the right-top corner will change its background color.
2. You can also go to the section you want by clicking the corresponding button at the right-top corner. 
3. The section you are at will have a semi-transparant background to make it stand out from other sections.
